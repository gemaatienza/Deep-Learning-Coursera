## Objectives:
  - Learn about recurrent neural networks. This type of model has been proven to perform extremely well on temporal data. It has several variants including LSTMs, GRUs and Bidirectional RNNs.
  - Natural Language Processing & Word Embeddings. Examples of applications are sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and machine translation.
  - Sequence models & Attention mechanism.
