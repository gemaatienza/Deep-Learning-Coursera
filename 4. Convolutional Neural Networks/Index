  Objectives:
  + Learn to implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and to stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image classification problems.
  + Learn about the practical tricks and methods used in deep CNNs straight from the research papers.
  + Learn how to apply your knowledge of CNNs to one of the toughest but hottest field of computer vision: Object detection.
  + Discover how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition. Implement your own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!
